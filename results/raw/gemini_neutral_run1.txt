🎯 Targeted Coaching RecommendationBased on the attributes provided, Player C (LW) should receive targeted coaching to become a stronger contributor next season.📝 JustificationThe recommendation focuses on Player C's defensive attributes, which are significantly lower than their offensive stats, creating a notable weakness that targeted coaching could address.Player C's AttributesPositionOVRFinDrbSPassIntSTackGKRefLW92879684362411Attacking Strength: Player C is a Left Winger (LW), a position focused on attacking. Their high Dribbling (Drb: 96) and strong Finishing (Fin: 87) confirm they are already a quality offensive player.Defensive Weakness: The critical area for improvement is defense, specifically Stand Tackle (STack: 24) and Interceptions (Int: 36). These are the lowest defensive ratings among the outfield players (A, B, C, H), even though Players A, B, and H also play attacking roles.PlayerPositionIntSTackPlayer ARF2228Player BST2931Player CLW3624Player HLF4127Modern wingers (LW/RF/LF) are often required to track back and contribute defensively. Player C's STack of 24 is exceptionally low, even for an attacker, and their Int of 36 is the second lowest. By targeting training in defensive awareness and tackling, the team can convert this glaring weakness into a more serviceable attribute, allowing Player C to be a more complete and reliable contributor in both phases of play.Note: Player D (GK) is excluded as their attributes are typical for a Goalkeeper (high GKRef: 94) and they operate in a specialized defensive role.This video on FM24 Attributes Explained - What's YOUR Judging Player Ability rating? explains how different attributes impact a player's ability and role, which is relevant for deciding what attributes to develop.
